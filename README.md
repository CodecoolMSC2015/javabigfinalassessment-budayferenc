We would like to search by giving skills and restrict the partial or fulfillment is required. It means all skills are required or at least one. We have employees and outsider contacts for persons persisted in our site specific store. Mainly we use csv files now.
# Software Analysis
The company has a central HR department and some local sites in other offices where some local data is stored and maintained as a csv data. We have to slice the software architecture to a 3 tiered application. First we have to implement a socket server to handle the locally stored data. It will be deployed to the sites. We have to serve a http service to browser clients that is able to communicate with socket servers. The browser clients can search everywhere and with socket server we can communicate in the LAN only therefore it is highly secured.
